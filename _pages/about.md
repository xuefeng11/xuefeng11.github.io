**Research:** My primary research focuses on two complementary directions.  
(1) **Machine Learning Foundations**: I develop theoretically grounded frameworks in reinforcement learning and advanced generative modeling, integrating active learning, imitation learning, and multi-expert learning to improve sample efficiency, policy selection, and exploration–exploitation trade-offs.  
(2) **AI for Life Sciences**, with a particular emphasis on **biomolecular design**, where I integrate biophysical and biological system modeling with modern machine learning methodologies, including RL, generative models, and foundation models. Classical computational approaches rooted in physics, chemistry, and molecular biophysics have long been essential for understanding biological mechanisms and guiding rational design in drug discovery and protein engineering, while recent advances in AI have reshaped how complex, high-dimensional, and data-scarce scientific problems are modeled, explored, and optimized.
<!-- Although these paradigms may appear distinct, I view them as deeply complementary. **Physical, chemical, and biological principles provide structure, interpretability, and inductive bias**, while **machine learning offers flexible, scalable, and data-efficient tools for navigating vast  design spaces and capturing complex biological dependencies**. By leveraging **large-scale multimodal biological data**, high-performance computing, and **interactive learning paradigms**, AI-driven approaches can move beyond static prediction toward **planning, decision-making, and closed-loop optimization** in complex scientific systems. -->

My research aims to address the “CURED” challenges—<u>C</u>ontrollability, Unified multimodality, Robustness, Efficiency, and Dependability on biophysical and biological principles—by tightly bridging first-principles modeling and modern AI. This framework underpins my work on protein and small-molecule design, binding affinity prediction, lead discovery and optimization, and autonomous scientific discovery workflows.


Research interests include, but are not limited to:
- Reinforcement learning, planning, and decision-making under uncertainty  
- Generative models and foundation models for biomolecular design and beyond
- Agentic AI and LLM-based reasoning for scientific discovery  
- Multimodal representation learning for biological systems  
- Active learning, interactive learning, and data-efficient optimization
- Physics- and biology-informed machine learning

<!-- ## Research

My primary research forcus on two direction. (1) **Machine Learning Foundations**: Developing theoretically grounded **reinforcement learning** and **advanced generative modeling** frameworks that integrate active learning, imitation learning, and multi-expert learning to enhance sample efficiency, policy selection, and exploration and exploitation mechanism. (2) **AI for Science**, with a particular focus on **AI for Life Sciences**, integrating **biophysical and biological system modeling** with modern machine learning methodologies such as **reinforcement learning, generative models, and foundation models**. Classical computational approaches grounded in physics, chemistry, and molecular biophysics have long been essential for understanding biological mechanisms and guiding rational design in areas such as drug discovery and protein engineering. In parallel, recent advances in artificial intelligence have reshaped how complex, high-dimensional, and data-scarce scientific problems can be modeled, explored, and optimized.

Although these paradigms may appear distinct, I view them as deeply complementary. **Physical, chemical, and biological principles provide structure, interpretability, and inductive bias**, while **machine learning offers flexible, scalable, and data-efficient tools for navigating vast combinatorial design spaces and capturing complex biological dependencies**. By leveraging **large-scale and multimodal biological data**, high-performance computing, and **interactive learning paradigms**, AI-driven approaches can move beyond static prediction toward **planning, decision-making, and closed-loop optimization** in complex scientific systems.

My research focuses on developing CURED system-  **Controllability, Unified multimodality, Robustness, Efficiency, and Dependability on biophysical & biological principles.** that bridge **first-principles modeling and modern AI**, with applications in **protein and small-molecule design, binding affinity prediction, lead discovery and optimization, and autonomous scientific discovery workflows**.

**Research interests include, but are not limited to:**
- Reinforcement learning, planning, and decision-making under uncertainty  
- Generative models and foundation models for molecular and protein design  
- Agentic AI and LLM-based reasoning for scientific discovery  
- Multimodal representation learning for biological and chemical systems
